# SignalR Proof of Concept
Quick mockup of a web applicaiton that uses Microsoft's SignalR tech to deliver server updates to clients. 

In this application, the server has a timer that constantly sends an update every set interval. By default, it is set to 5 seconds per update. Users can change the interval through the available buttons, as well as start and stop. This also demonstrates another capability of SignalR: client to server communication.
